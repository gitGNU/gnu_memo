About
=====
Memo is a recursive acronym standing for Memo Enables Memory Optimisation.

Memo's purpose is enhancing it's user ability to remember foreign words and
phrases by regular repetition of properly chosen material. Memo regularly
sends emails containing packs of words or phrases to be translated by the
receiver.  User replies to the email filling in the answers. Memo parses the
reply and updates it's database with users results. Sets of questions for
every test are chosen basing on user's performance in previous tests - the
words that are most difficult for the user are sent more frequently.

Requirements
============

The following software is required to run Memo.

 - mailx <http://heirloom.sourceforge.net/mailx.html>.
 - procmail <http://www.procmail.org/>.
 - Some essential tools, such as bash, awk, grep and sed. All of these can be
   found in the GNU operation system <http://www.gnu.org>.

Besides, you are going to need a shell account.

Installation
============

Just do

  $ ./configure && make install

as there is nothing to make. Details may be found in the INSTALL file.

Before the first execution
==========================

The current, very immature version of Memo requires some preparation before
usage. First of all install Memo. In the rest of this part of README it will
be assumed that executable 'memo' is available in your $PATH.

After Memo has been installed, you need to construct or fetch a words database
and save it in '~/.memo/db' file. It's format is following:

word|translation|positive_answers|negative_answers

Two first fields are strings consisting of nearly any characters besides '|',
two other are integers. At the beginning all positive and negative answers
count should be zeroed. Lines beginning with a has are ignored. Following
lines are an example of an initial database.

kot|cat|0|0
pies|dog|0|0
# End of animals, beginning food category
mleko|milk|0|0
flaki wołowe|beef tripe|0|0

Create a ~/.memo/memo.rc file and add to it following two lines:

MEMO_FROM="email_to_which_replies_to_tests_will_be_directed@example.org"
MEMO_TO="email_to_which_send_test@example.org"

Both addresses may be the same, obviously.

Having a database and a configuration file you are ready to send tests. Now
it's time to configure receiving. Be sure that your incoming mail is filtered
by procmail. If it is not, find out how to enable it at procmail's
documentation. Afterwards add to your ~/.procmailrc the following rule.

:0:
* ^Subject: Re: memo ([0-9]*)
| memo -r

Now procmail should forward your replies to Memo's tests to the Memo's parser.
It's time to give it a first shot.

  $ memo -s

Usage
=====
Consider adding to your crontab the following line, adjusted to your needs.

19  12  *   *   *   memo -s

Don't forget to inform the authors in case of spotting a bug or any other
unwanted behavior which doesn't seem to be a feature.

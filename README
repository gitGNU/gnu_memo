Memo is a recursive acronym standing for Memo Enables Memory Optimisation.

Memo's purpose is enhancing its user's ability to remember foreign words and
phrases by regular repetition of a properly chosen material. Memo can be used
to regularly send emails containing packs of words or phrases to be translated
by the receiver. User replies to the e-mail filling in the answers. Memo
parses the reply and updates its internal database with user's results. Sets
of questions for every test are chosen basing on user's performance in
previous tests -- the words that are most difficult for the user are sent more
frequently.

Memo's manual is maintained in the Texinfo format. The source file is
'doc/memo.texi' and it may be converted to various other formats using the
makeinfo utility by calling 'make pdf', 'make html' or 'make info'.

Technical documentation may be generated using Doxygen. The required Doxyfile
is created by the 'configure' script.

Copying conditions are available in the 'COPYING' file. Detailed installing
instructions can be found in the 'INSTALL' file.

Please report all bugs or unexpected behaviour.
